# ,,, (Commata)

,,, is a programming language designed for golfing.

It is currently very underdeveloped which may cause many breaking changes.

## Why?

It was really only made because the creator really wanted to make a language. However, ,,, doesn't do terrible in golfing competitions and utilizes Unicode characters that are often very descriptive of their purpose.

    commata [-h] file args

    Positional arguments:
      file        program read from script file
      args        arguments for the script
